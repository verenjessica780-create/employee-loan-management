# Employee-Loan-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
This project demonstrates the transformation of raw, unstructured employee loan data into a clean and reliable analytical dataset.  Through data cleaning and restructuring, the dataset evolved from a format unsuitable for analysis into a structured table that enables insightful reporting, trend analysis, and dashboard creation. Built using Excel and Power Query to track total loans, outstanding balances, repayments, and loan distribution by site.
## Before Data Cleaning
[Employee Loans Before Edit (Excel File)](https://github.com/verenjessica780-create/employee-loan-management/blob/main/1%20Employee%20Loans%20Before%20Edit.xlsx)

Before data cleaning, the employee loan data was stored in an unstructured and inconsistent format.  
Monthly loan deductions were spread across multiple columns without standardization, making the data difficult to filter, aggregate, or analyze.  
Because the data is not in a proper tabular format and contains inconsistent layouts across rows and columns, it cannot be directly used for Pivot Tables, dashboards, or analysis.
This condition highlights the need for data standardization and restructuring before analysis can be performed. As a result, the data could not be effectively used for Pivot Tables, dashboards, or any form of meaningful analysis.

This image shows an example of raw employee loan data before data cleaning and transformation.
The data structure is highly unorganized and inconsistent, making it difficult to process, filter, or analyze.

## After Data Cleaning & Transformation

After data cleaning and transformation, the employee loan data was standardized into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready table.  
Using Power Query, the data was reorganized into consistent columns, unnecessary formatting was removed, and data types were standardized. \

Monthly loan deductions were normalized into a proper tabular structure, enabling efficient filtering, pivoting, and aggregation.

This clean dataset now supports accurate analysis, KPI calculation, and dashboard visualization for employee loan monitoring and reporting.
